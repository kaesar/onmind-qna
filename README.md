## How to Start the Service for OnMind-QNA

To avoid **CORS** issues when loading files, avoid opening the `index.html` file directly. It's recommended to use a local web server. Here are some alternatives to expose the web page as a local service...

### Python (if you have Python installed)

It's common for **macOS** systems to have **Python** installed (and some **Linux** distributions too).

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

> For **Python 2.7** version use: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

### Bun (if you don't have Python installed)

A good alternative is to install **Bun** (from command line or terminal) and then a module that acts as a web server (based on **Javascript** environment).

```bash
# Install Bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.com/install | bash  # for macOS, Linux, and WSL
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex" # for Windows

# Install global server
bun install -g http-server

# Run server
bunx http-server -p 8000
```

### PHP (if you have PHP installed):

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```

### Open OnMind-QNA web application

Just open a browser and use the address: `http://localhost:8000`

## Application Usage

1. **Configure**: 
   - Set the question file name (default: `Quiz.md`)
   - Select the desired number of questions (1-50)
2. **Start**: Click "Start Quiz"
3. **Answer**: Select an option for each question
4. **Navigate**: Use "Next Question" to advance
5. **Results**: Review your score and detailed answers
6. **Repeat**: Start a new quiz with different questions

## Testing and Development

### Running Tests

The project includes complete testing tools:

#### Main Test Suite
```bash
# Open test runner
open test-runner.html
# or navigate to http://localhost:8000/test-runner.html
```

#### Integration Tests
```bash
# Open complete integration tests
open integration-test.html
# or navigate to http://localhost:8000/integration-test.html
```

### Development Tools

- **Performance Monitor**: Real-time performance monitoring
- **Responsive Tester**: Automated responsiveness testing
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and edge cases
- **Test Data**: Test files in `test-data/`

### Testing Structure
```
test-data/
â”œâ”€â”€ test-questions.md       # Test questions
â”œâ”€â”€ malformed-questions.md  # Edge cases and errors
test-runner.html           # Automated test suite
integration-test.html      # E2E integration tests
```

## Development

This project is implemented in vanilla **JavaScript** without external dependencies. It uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Semantic HTML5, CSS3 with responsive design
- **JavaScript**: ES6+ with native modules
- **APIs**: File API for local file reading
- **Parsing**: Optimized regular expressions
- **Testing**: Complete automated test suite
- **Performance**: Real-time monitoring and optimization

### Architecture

- `app.js` - Main orchestrator and event handling
- `markdown-parser.js` - Question extraction and validation
- `quiz-engine.js` - Quiz logic and scoring
- `ui-controller.js` - Interface management and navigation
- `file-handler.js` - File loading and validation
- `performance-monitor.js` - Performance monitoring
- `responsive-tester.js` - Responsiveness testing

## Requirements

### Minimum
- Modern web browser with ES6+ support
- Markdown file with questions in root directory (`Quiz.md` by default)

### Recommended
- Local web server to avoid CORS restrictions
- Minimum resolution: 375px (mobile)
- JavaScript enabled

### Supported Browsers
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## ðŸ“± Responsive Features

- **Mobile**: â‰¤ 768px - Touch-optimized interface
- **Tablet**: 769px - 1024px - Hybrid design
- **Desktop**: > 1024px - Complete experience

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot load file"
- Use a local server instead of opening the file directly
- Verify that the specified question file exists in the root directory
- Check that the filename is correct in the configuration

### Error: "No questions found"
- Check the Markdown file format
- Make sure questions follow the expected format:
  ```markdown
  ## Question XXX
  
  Question content
  
  A. Option A
  B. Option B
  
  <as-button message="A"></as-button>
  ```
- Verify the correct filename is configured in the application

### Performance Issues
- Open `integration-test.html` for diagnostics
- Check browser console for warnings
- Consider reducing the number of questions for very large files
